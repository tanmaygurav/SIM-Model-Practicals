Prac 4: SEIR - System Dynamic
1. Create model with time units as days.
2. Place stock and flow for Suceptible, ExposedRate, Exposed, InfectiousRate, Infectious, RecoveredRate, Recovered.
3. Add 5 parameteres
    ● TotalPopulation = 10 000
    ● Infectivity = 0.6
    ● ContactRateInfectious = 1.25
    ● AverageIncubationTime = 10
    ● AverageIllnessDuration = 15
4. initialvalue, draw expected links as suggested: 
Infectious = 1, Suceptible = TotalPopulation-1, 
5. flow formulae
ExposedRate - Infectious * ContactRateInfectious * Infectivity * Suceptible / TotalPopulation
InfectiousRate - Exposed/AverageIncubationTime
RecoveredRate - Infectious/AverageIllnessDuration
6. Place loop and set type = R
7. Place TimePlot and add All stocks as data and set values respectively
8. Right click on Infectious to create Dataset: Keep 300 samples
9. New Experiment: type = Parameter Variation
10. Set parameter type to range, add min, max and step values / Model time: stop time = 300 days / Click =Create UI
11. Place TimePlot: timewindow 300 model time units
12. Java Actions: After Sim run = plot.addDataSet(root.InfectiousDS,"CR="+format(root.ContactRateInfection));
13. Place Table function name InfectiousHistory and copy HistoricData.txt from clipboard.: out of range= Nearest
14. New Experiment: type = Calibration
15. set parameter Infectivity, ContactRateInfection type as continuous, set min 0.005, 0.01 and max 1,3
16. Add Criteria: Title= Infectious cure match, Match = data series, Simulation op= root.InfectiousDS, Observed data= root.InfectiousHistory, Coeffei= 1.0

Prac 5: Job shop - Discret Event
1. Model time units = minutes, add image shape from presentation palete jobshop.png and lock image
2. Space Markup palette - Use Rectangular Node to make receivingDock, forkliftParking and add Path element connecting their border.
3. Add Pallete rack: properties
    ● Set Type to: two racks, one aisle
    ● Number of cells: 10
    ● Level height: 10
    ● In the Position and size section:
    ● Length:160
    ● Left pallet rack depth:14
    ● Right pallet rack depth:14
    ● Aisle width: 11
Process flow chart 4 to 6
4. Process Modeling - Source
    ● name = sourcePallets
    ● Arrivals defined by = Interarrival Time
    ● Interarrival Time = 5 min
    ● First arrival = model start
    ● Location of arrival = GIS node - receivingDock
    after 8
    ● New Agent = Pallet, add boxes
5. Process Modeling - Rack Store
    ● name = storeRawMaterial
    ● Pallet Rack = palletRack
    ● Agent Location = receivingDock
    after 7
    ● Resources - use resource to move = check
    ● alternatives = forklifts
    ● Return Home = if no other tasks
    ●

6. Process Modeling - Delay
    ● name = rawMaterialInStorage
    ● Delay Time = triangular( 15, 20, 30 ) minutes
    ● Max capaity = check
6. Process Modeling - Rack Pick
    ● name = pickRawMaterial
    ● Pallet Rack = palletRack
    ● Node = forkliftParking
    after 7
    ● Resources - use resource to move = check
    ● alternatives = forklifts
    ● Return Home = if no other tasks
    ●
7. Process Modeling - ResourcePool
    ● name = forklift
    ● create custom type - ForkliftTruck
    ● capaity = 5
    ● New resource unit = ForkliftTruck
    ● Speed = 1 meter/s
    ● Home Location = forkliftParking
8. Add camera and 3D Window and set coordinates, Add walls and set properties you like
9. Add wall
